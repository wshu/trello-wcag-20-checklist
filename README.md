# Trello WCAG 2.0 Checklist

For accessibility audit work we use a variety of online tools including Trello which compliments our working style.

Thought the *public [clean] version* of the WCAG 2.0 ([including WCAG 2.1 Editor's Draft](https://w3c.github.io/wcag21/guidelines/)) done on this platform may be of use to others as well.
